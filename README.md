> This is a proof of what i thought cloud-sdk would be please check https://github.com/navicstein/sails-hook-cloud for the global sailsjs hook (not yet released on npm!) [fast finger]

i have plans to release this lib on npm and made available via unpkg after proper verification with the sails team
